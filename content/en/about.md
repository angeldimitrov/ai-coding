# About Me

I'm Angel Dimitrov — CTO, founder, and consultant with over 15 years of experience in building and leading engineering teams.  
I spent more than a decade running my own software agency, working hands-on with clients across industries and delivering complex projects end-to-end.  
Along the way, I co-founded startups and held leadership roles at companies like Home24, Zalando, Flaconi, Republik, Schwarz Gruppe, and Rocket Internet — giving me experience from early-stage ventures to enterprise-scale organizations.  

Today, I focus on helping companies explore and integrate AI-driven development workflows.  
Through consulting, pilots, and workshops, I support engineering leaders in accelerating delivery, cutting costs, and improving software quality — while setting their teams up for the future of software development.
